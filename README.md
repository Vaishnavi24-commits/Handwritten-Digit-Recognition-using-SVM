# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-SVM
Implemented a machine learning model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to recognize handwritten digits from the popular sklearn Digits dataset
Implemented a machine learning model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) to recognize handwritten digits from the popular sklearn Digits dataset. Compared different kernel types (linear, poly, rbf, sigmoid) and gamma values to identify the best-performing combination. Evaluated the model using accuracy scores on a test split. Tools Used: Python, Scikit-learn, SVM (Support Vector Classifier), Accuracy Metrics
